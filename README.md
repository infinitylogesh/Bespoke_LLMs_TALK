# Talk: Bespoke LLMs - Building and Scaling customized large language models

Slides and code for the talk at Analytics Vidhya's [DHS 2023](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/datahack-summit-2023/session/bespoke-llms-building-and-scaling-customized-large-language-models/) event and Saama's Tech meetup on 29th June 2023. 

I spoke about the benefits of building custom LLMs by adapting open source models for enterprises, including the process ( data collection, preprocessing, and training ) and tools & techniques for a successful adaptation.
